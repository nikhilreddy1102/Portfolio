        </h2>

        <p className="text-base sm:text-[17px] lg:text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 text-left">
          Over the past four years, I’ve designed and developed enterprise-grade
          <strong>{' '}microservices</strong>, <strong>APIs</strong>, and 
          <strong>{' '}responsive interfaces</strong> across industries such as
          <strong>{' '}banking, healthcare, and media</strong>. My expertise spans
          <strong>{' '}Java (8–17), Spring Boot,</strong> and <strong>distributed systems</strong> 
          on the backend, and <strong>React/Next.js</strong> with 
          <strong>{' '}Tailwind CSS</strong> on the frontend, all deployed through
          <strong>{' '}CI/CD pipelines</strong> on AWS and Azure.
        </p>

        <p className="text-base sm:text-[17px] lg:text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 text-left">
          I’ve implemented secure architectures with <strong>OAuth2</strong>, 
          <strong>{' '}JWT</strong>, and <strong>Kafka</strong> for real-time messaging,
          while containerizing applications with <strong>Docker</strong> and 
          <strong>{' '}Kubernetes</strong> to ensure high availability.
        </p>

        <p className="text-base sm:text-[17px] lg:text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 text-left">
          With proven experience in <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms</strong>,
          I apply graph-based models, optimization techniques, and efficient query
          strategies to improve performance and stability.

          Experienced in <strong>agile delivery</strong> and
          <strong>{' '}cross-functional collaboration</strong>, I’m passionate about
          roles that challenge me to architect scalable microservices, optimize
          performance, and create engaging user experiences in full-stack or
          frontend engineering.
